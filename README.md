# Random Exploits: a collection of pwn challenges and exploit scripts 

## Introduction
This is a repository I use to collect various pwn challenges I found around or I exploited. Most of them include the challenge's source code and a commented exploit (usually written in Python). Complete series of challenges (like ROP Emporium) are usually in their own repositories.
## Usage
```
git clone https://github.com/last-byte/RandomExploits.git
cd ./RandomExploits/$CHALLENGE/
python exploit.py
```
